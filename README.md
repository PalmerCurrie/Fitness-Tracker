# Fitness Tracker

The **Fitness Tracker** will allow users to track individual workouts *(exercise, sets, reps, weight, duration)*, 
manage their day-to-day exercises, and view their progress made over time. 
This app will be designed for any fitness enthusiast, or any person looking to improve their physical health.
This project is of interest to me because I myself am and active person and want to start getting into the habit of
tracking and reviewing my workouts. This will better allow me to view my progress and reflect on the work I have
put into my personal fitness levels which is why I want to design this project.
